## 💻 Project

This project was developed during the Hero Week Bootcamp at Hero Code. During this process,
a real-time communication system was developed, including chat, audio, and sharing. I was able to learn the benefits of real-time chat, using concepts
of Websockets and bidirectional communication, as well as building the interface using React to create components and routes, and styling with Tailwind.
